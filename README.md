## What is a linked list?

A data structure that contains a **head**, **tail** and **length** property.
Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each **node** has a **value** and a **pointer** to another node or null

## Comparisons with Arrays

### Array

- Indexed in order!
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index

### List

- Do not have indexes!
- Connected via nodes with a **next** pointer
- Random access is not allowed

## Singly Linked Lists? Doubly Linked Lists?

In Singly Linked Lists, each node has only one pointer to the **next** node.
In Doubly Linked Lists, each node has two pointers to the **next** node and the **previous** node.

More memory, More Flexibility in Doubly Linked Lists! It's **almost** always a tradeoff

## List Methods

- [x] Push : Adding a new node to the end of the Linked List.

- [x] Pop : Removing a node from the end of the Linked List.

- [x] Shift : Removing a new node from the beginning of the Linked List.

- [x] Unshift : Adding a new node to the beginning of the Linked List.

- [x] Get : Retrieving a node by it's position in the Linked List.

- [x] Set : Changing the value of a node based on it's position in the Linked List.

- [x] Insert : Adding a node to the Linked List at a specific position.

- [x] Remove : Removing a node from the Linked List at a specific position.

- [x] Reverse : Reversing the Linked List in place.

## What is a STACK?

A **LIFO** data structure where the **_last_** value **_in_** is always the **_first_** one **_out_**.!

- Managing function invocations
- Undo / Redo
- Routing (the history object, pages you have visited and go back/forward)

<br>

## What is a QUEUE?

A **FIFO** data structure where the **_first_** value **_in_** is always the **_first_** one **_out_**.

- Background tasks
- Uploading resources
- Printing / Task processing

<br>

## Stack Methods

- [x] Push : Add a value to the top of the stack.

- [x] Pop : Remove a value from the top of the stack.

<br>

## Queue Methods

- [x] Enqueue : Adding to the **beginning** of the Queue.

- [x] Dequeue : Removing from the beginning of the Queue.
